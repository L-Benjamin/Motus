# Benjamin's Motus

## About

Minimal recreaction of the french TV show [Motus](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motus_(jeu_t%C3%A9l%C3%A9vis%C3%A9)) (known as [Lingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingo_(American_game_show)) in the US) as a web app.

The backend is a simple [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) + [express](http://expressjs.com/) server. The frontend is in vanilla framework-less html + javascript.

The MVP (as seen in the first commit) was coded in exactly 2h30.

The dictionary used to lookup words is the official french scrabble dictionary. Thus, the game might be a "little" harder than other variants found online. The interface is also in french.

## Using

Make sure [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or another javascript dependency resolver is installed. Then do:
```bash
npm install
```

Once this is done, you can run the server with:
```bash
npm run start
```

This will print an url you can follow to the website.
